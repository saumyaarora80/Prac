# In[2]:


#data structure= arrangement of data in a computers memory or disk. it have array, queues,linked list etc
#major operation = searching traversing inserting deleting etc
#advantages of data storage = use in complexx problems, allows safe storage of information etc
#linear data structure= sequence order arangement
#we use data structure in compiler os dbms graphics RDBMS etc


# In[3]:


arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(arr)
print(len(arr))

#steps to find sum of array
#take one
#declare sum variable 


# In[ ]:


#linked list
#they are single double and circular
#they perform all operations sequentially
#they are collection of nodes connected by the links in any order 

#operations 
#createnode()
#insertnode()
#deletenode()
#displaynode() etc

#applications
#used in graphs
#used in playing 
#in recognizinig palindrome

#Nosql is of graphs based objects base and data base
#optimization in the on bad network

#advantages
#access items as long as external liml is maintained 
#delete existing item without shifting
#size can be expanded

#disaadvantages


# single linked list

# In[ ]:


#it is a collection of nodes
#it is the most basic type of list in c
#it is simple and dynamically allocated
#each node has its successor and predecessor
#here the address of first node is always stored in a refrence node known as front or head and next node is always stored at lastknown as null


# INSERT A NEW ELEMETNT AT A GIVEN POINT IN A LINKED LIST

		# Assign data
		self.data = data
